# grafana
Grafana with Telegraf and InfluxDB

# Things to take note of:
* Read these files, you will see several things that need to be changed for your install.
* Examples would be server names, usernames, passwords, etc.
* I did my best to make it obvious what to change, and to what.
* Once again, read the files... once all of that is changed all you have to do is init the compose and you're good.
